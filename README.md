[ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a framework for building large, complex user interfaces. 

[Flybase](https://flybase.io/) complements it perfectly by providing an easy-to-use, realtime data source for populating the `state` of React components. 

With ReactFly, it only takes a few lines of JavaScript to integrate Flybase data into React apps via the `ReactFlyMixin`.
